In randomized trials, we talk a lot about blinding. But an equally important and subtly different concept is **allocation concealment**.

They are not the same thing.

-   **Blinding** protects against bias *after* treatment is assigned (e.g., biased outcome assessment).

-   **Allocation concealment** protects against bias at the moment of enrollment *before* treatment is assigned.

And this is exactly where **block size** becomes dangerous.

## Regulatory and Reporting Standards Emphasize Concealment — Not Disclosure of Block Size

Major regulatory and reporting guidance documents are clear about the importance of allocation concealment — but notably **do not require disclosure of block size in protocols or SAPs**.

**ICH E9 (Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials)**

ICH E9 states:

> “The method of randomisation should ensure that treatment allocation is unpredictable.”

Unpredictability is the core principle. If the block size is known to investigators, predictability can arise — directly conflicting with this requirement.

**ICH E6 (Good Clinical Practice)**

ICH E6 emphasizes safeguarding the randomization process:

> “The investigator should ensure that the randomization procedures are followed and that the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol.”

Maintaining control of the randomization schedule — including operational details like block size — is part of preserving its integrity.

**CONSORT 2010 Statement**

CONSORT distinguishes clearly between:

-   **Sequence generation**

-   **Allocation concealment mechanism**

Item 9 of the CONSORT 2010 checklist requires:

> “Mechanism used to implement the random allocation sequence (such as sequentially numbered containers), describing any steps taken to conceal the sequence until interventions were assigned.”

Importantly, CONSORT focuses on *how concealment was ensured*, not on revealing details that would undermine it.

## The Purpose of Block Randomization

Block randomization is used to maintain approximate treatment balance throughout enrollment.

For example, in a 1:1 trial with block size 4, each block contains:

-   2 assignments to Treatment A

-   2 assignments to Treatment B

The order within the block is randomized. This helps prevent large imbalances if enrollment stops early.

## The Problem: Predictability

If investigators know the block size, allocation can become **predictable**.

Imagine:

-   1:1 randomization

-   Block size = 4

-   Three patients in a block have already been assigned: A, B, A

What is the fourth assignment?

It must be B.

At that point, allocation is no longer random in practice — it is deducible.

The mere ability to anticipate the next assignment can influence enrollment decisions in small but systematic ways:

-   Delaying enrollment of a "difficult" patient

-   Accelerating enrollment of a "good prognosis" patient

-   Selectively enrolling borderline-eligible patients

This introduces **selection bias**, even in a formally randomized trial. That is a failure of allocation concealment.

## Allocation Concealment ≠ Blinding

Even in an open-label trial (no blinding), allocation concealment must still be protected.

Blinding protects:

-   Outcome assessment

-   Patient behavior

-   Investigator expectations

Allocation concealment protects:

-   **The integrity of who gets assigned what**

You can have:

-   A blinded trial with broken allocation concealment

-   An open-label trial with perfect allocation concealment

They are conceptually distinct safeguards.

## Why Block Size Does Not Belong in the Protocol or SAP

The protocol and SAP are often widely distributed:

-   Investigators

-   Coordinators

-   Sponsors

-   Regulators

-   Data monitoring committees

If the block size is written there, it is no longer protected.

Even stating: ""Randomization will use permuted blocks of size 4" is enough to compromise concealment.

Best practice is:

-   The protocol states that blocked randomization will be used.

-   The SAP describes the randomization method in general terms.

-   The **actual block size (and any random variation in block size)** is known only to:

    -   The unblinded statistician

    -   The randomization unit/vendor/system

This protects allocation concealment while still maintaining transparency about the design.

## Fixed Block Sizes

Using a fixed block size makes predictability easier.

A better approach is:

-   Randomly varying block sizes (e.g., 2 and 4)

This dramatically reduces predictability. But even then, disclosing the possible block sizes weakens protection.

## The Statistical Consequences of Broken Allocation Concealment

Empirical evidence shows that trials with inadequate allocation concealment:

-   Overestimate treatment effects

-   Exhibit exaggerated efficacy signals

-   Show increased selection bias

This is not theoretical. Allocation concealment is one of the strongest methodological predictors of unbiased treatment effect estimates.

## What the Protocol *Should* Say

Instead of specifying block size, a protocol can say:

> Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a centralized, computer-generated permuted block randomization schedule. Details of the randomization sequence will be maintained by the unblinded statistician to ensure allocation concealment.

That is sufficient. Regulators do not require disclosure of block size in public-facing documents.

## Takeaway

-   Block size is an operational detail — not a scientific one.

-   Its disclosure does not improve reproducibility, transparency, or statistical validity. But it can undermine allocation concealment.

-   And once allocation concealment is compromised, the trial is vulnerable to selection bias even if it remains fully blinded.

-   Protecting allocation concealment is protecting the integrity of randomization itself.

-   Block size belongs with the unblinded randomization statistician/unit and nowhere else.

-   Regulators do not require disclosure of block size in public-facing documents.
