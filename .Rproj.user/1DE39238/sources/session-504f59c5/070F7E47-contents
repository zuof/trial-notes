This site is devoted to improving epilepsy clinical trial design and analysis. Emphasis is placed on maximizing information, reducing bias, and defining estimands and endpoints that reflect meaningful clinical benefit. I discuss trial design, seizure-count and time-to-event outcomes, missing data, placebo response, multiplicity, heterogeneity of treatment effect, and the gap between statistical significance and clinical decision-making. Practical R examples accompany many posts.
