## The clinician question (and the key misunderstanding)

A common objection I hear is: “It makes no sense to adjust for patient age in seizure analyses: age isn’t known to predict seizures in this population.”

This mixes up two different goals:

-   **Causal/Scientific explanation** (“does age cause seizures?”)

-   **Precision in estimating a randomized treatment effect** (“can age explain outcome variability within arms?”)

In a randomized trial, covariate adjustment uses *baseline information* to explain some of the outcome heterogeneity that would otherwise sit in the residual error term. Less residual noise → **smaller standard error** → **more power**, for the *same* sample size.

Even if a covariate is only a **weak** predictor, it can still help. And importantly:

-   If the covariate is truly unrelated to the outcome, adjustment usually costs little (you may lose a hair of precision, but often negligible), while

-   If it explains even modest variability, gains can be meaningful.

## A simple “why it works”  

For many common estimators (e.g., ANCOVA-type adjustment in linear models), a rough rule of thumb is:
$$
\mathrm{Var}(\hat{\Delta}_{\text{adj}})
\approx
(1 - R^2)\,
\mathrm{Var}(\hat{\Delta}_{\text{unadj}})
$$

where R^2 is the proportion of outcome variability explained by baseline covariates *within arms*.

So if baseline covariates explain even **10%** of the variability (R^2=0.10), you can get about a **10% variance reduction**, i.e. about a **5% SE reduction**. That can matter a lot for borderline-powered trials.

## Simulation setup: seizure counts with heterogeneous baseline risk

We’ll simulate a parallel-group trial with a seizure-count outcome. The true treatment effect is a constant rate ratio (no treatment-by-age interaction). Age affects baseline seizure rate modestly—*not because we claim it’s causal*, but because it captures real-world heterogeneity (disease duration, comorbidities, adherence patterns, etiologic mix, etc.) that differs across individuals.
