If the block size is known to investigators, predictability can arise — directly conflicting with this requirement.\nICH E6 (Good Clinical Practice)\nICH E6 emphasizes safeguarding the randomization process:\n\n“The investigator should ensure that the randomization procedures are followed and that the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol.”\n\nMaintaining control of the randomization schedule including operational details like block size is part of preserving its integrity.\nCONSORT 2010 Statement\nCONSORT distinguishes clearly between:\n\nSequence generation\nAllocation concealment mechanism\n\nItem 9 of the CONSORT 2010 checklist requires:\n\n“Mechanism used to implement the random allocation sequence (such as sequentially numbered containers), describing any steps taken to conceal the sequence until interventions were assigned.”\n\nImportantly, CONSORT focuses on how concealment was ensured, not on revealing details that would undermine it."

This helps prevent large imbalances if enrollment stops early."

It is deducible.\nThe mere ability to anticipate the next assignment can influence enrollment decisions in small but systematic ways:\n\nDelaying enrollment of a “difficult” patient\nAccelerating enrollment of a “good prognosis” patient\nSelectively enrolling borderline-eligible patients\n\nThis introduces selection bias, even in a formally randomized trial.
